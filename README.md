Genshin Impact Wiki Sites Data
==============================

**Genshin Impact Wiki Data**, inspired by another great work [impact-api](https://github.com/impact-moe/impact-api), is
**a collection of dynamically generated data that describe facts or inferred facts from the game Genshin
Impact**.

> The following criteria shall be honored by the data in order for itself to be included in this collection:
>
> 1. The semantic meaning of the data is defined within the context of **Genshin Impact only**
> 2. The data is **automatically** generated and its generator is referenced to make sure the data can be regenerated at
>    any time (_Please see the example in [Data](#data) section below_)
> 3. The data is in [**JSON** format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and the Chinese/Korean/Japanese characters are
>    displayed in UTF-8 properly so that it is both human-readable and machine-programmable
